# Voxel Receptive Field (vRF) mapping stimuli

Stimuli useful for voxel receptive field (vRF, sometimes called population receptive field, pRF) modeling and retinotopic mapping in parietal and frontal cortex (as in [Mackey et al, 2017, eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/22974))

Several adaptations from the exact stimulus used in Mackey et al, 2017:
- multiple bar sizes within same run
- equated motion energy across coherence levels

If you use these stimuli in published reports, please cite Mackey et al, 2017 and this GitHub repository.
